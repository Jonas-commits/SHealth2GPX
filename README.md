## History
On a rainy day I wanted to show a heatmap of my Samsung workout data. While there are a lot of GPX tools out there and also ways to export single filesfrom Samsung Health to GPX, i could not find an easy way to export all files to GPX that's why i created this script

## Usage
* First step: download a data copy from your Samsung Health account. Instrcutions: https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00085104/
* Copy the whole dataset to the PC
* Execute the program and select the downloaded folder
* A new directory 'SHealth2GPX' is created within the data copy folder. In this folders, there are placed the exported gpx files, grouped in folders by activity and named by activity start date
